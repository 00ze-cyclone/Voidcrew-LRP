changes:
  - code_imp: Speeds up a lot of more intensive parts of the code
  - bugfix: Specifically notable is the lag that used to occur when any ship was attempting
      to land. This was fixed by making the reservation turf filling have an additional
      CHECK_TICK.
  - bugfix: Large asteroids are no longer weirdly coloured sometimes
