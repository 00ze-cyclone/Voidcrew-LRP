changes:
  - config: Added settings to the Visual Studio Code that will help maintain consistency
      across the code.
  - code_imp: Indentation and similar use of whitespacing have undergone a major consistency
      update. So the code should be more clean now. Developers do not have to worry
      about fixing the most whitespaces for now.
