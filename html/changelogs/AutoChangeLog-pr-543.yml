changes:
  - bugfix: a syndishit traitor working at the cargo crate construction line sabotaged
      the access locks on all security crates or some shit, so they got fixed by a
      purple skeleton
  - bugfix: there were many inconsistencies in the prices of mineral shipments, but
      there aren't anymore
