changes:
  - rscadd: Virtual z-levels
  - tweak: Each ~~shuttle~~ turf reservation will be treated as a different z-level,
      meaning things that affect a z-level (Comms, suit sensors, AI upload, explosions,
      etc.) will no longer be able to track different shuttles while they are in transit.
