changes:
  - rscadd: A particularly drippy outfit. Don't take it off!
  - rscadd: The ascetic's garb, an overwear item that speeds up the wearer and surrounds
      them in a protective desert wind. Singificantly increases damage taken when
      shield is down.
  - rscadd: Ports the Ice Cube artifact from /TG/
  - rscadd: Ports spur from Yogstation, reworks it slightly to rebalance it to mining
      pool standards.
  - rscadd: Ports tribal torch from F13 and adds the associated crafting recipe
  - rscadd: New cursed katana sprites and aesthetic.
  - rscadd: A number of artefact item icons ported from modern /TG/
  - rscadd: Concussion Gauntlets! Special martial art content incoming.
  - tweak: Replaces soulstone with a nerfed necrostone
  - tweak: Assigns new sprites to the Paradox bag, and nerfs its storage capacity
  - tweak: A mining scanner has been added to the diamond pickaxe necroloot drop.
  - tweak: An envy's knife has been added to the voodoo doll drop. (thematic appropriateness)
  - balance: The cursed heart's "beat" ability can now be triggered when stunned or
      cuffed. Bloodloss from missing a beat has been halved. Pending possible nerfs
      to heal amount if this is too busted.
  - balance: Redesigned immortality talisman to be more generally useful, and to accept
      a custom BIG SCARY SHOUT
  - balance: Redesigns Hook Shot item to apply fast attacks in melee range.
  - tweak: Added new pathing to some necro items, and reorganized list to contain
      two less items (for now)
  - balance: Removed Jacob's Ladder and Dark Blessing from the necropolis loot pool.
  - balance: Added buffed rework of possessed blade to necroloot pool, gaining amplified
      damage, block chance, and bloodletting
  - balance: Reworks cursed blade to cause acts of hubris and occasionally painful
      death
  - balance: Buffed all the elite items from useless to ok, since you can only get
      them in the first place by fighting a pvp megafauna
  - tweak: gave the necropolis chest power miner a small chance to drop a chooseable
      version, instead. Spin the wheel of overwhelmingly low chances.
  - tweak: removes ability to choose gravokinetic guardian until the game-breaking
      visual bugs are fixed.
