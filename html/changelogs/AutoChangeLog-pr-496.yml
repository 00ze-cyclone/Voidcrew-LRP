  - rscadd: Added the ability to markup your chat in (L)OOC and IC communication channels.
      Surrounding a block of text with underscores will italicize it and surrounding
      it with two asterisks will bold it, similar to traditional markdown. Credit
      to Aurora for the concept and part of the code.
