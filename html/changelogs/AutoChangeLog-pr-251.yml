changes:
  - rscadd: You can now pick up Teshari into mob holders. Teshari and other holdable
      mobs cannot pick up other holdable mobs to prevent recursion of any kind.

      and optional body colour.

      Schechi.
  - rscadd: You can now only put <b>one</b> mob holder into a duffel bag, and no other
      bags.
  - bugfix: Teshari actually have eyes now
  - bugfix: You can no longer eat some simplemobs alive (if you know, you know)
  - bugfix: mob holders can now breathe in bags
  - tweak: Minor Teshari diet adjustment, they now prefer meat and dislike grain/gross
      foods.
  - tweak: Teshari blood is no longer ammonia.
