changes:
  - bugfix: The crew manifest will no longer error after a ship has been deleted.
  - bugfix: Fixed a runtime related to sorting the manifest
  - bugfix: Adds more sanity checking to ship purchasing code
  - bugfix: Hyperspace no longer instantly QDELs mobs, instead just damaging them
      rapidly. It also doesn't delete effects such as LIGHT SOURCES so that bug is
      gone. Normal objects still qdel, though.
  - rscdel: Finally removes unused shuttles on centcom.
  - bugfix: OOC lag that everyone hates
