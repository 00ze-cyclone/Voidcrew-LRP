changes:
  - bugfix: Postround reconnection should work again.
  - tweak: Stat panel tabs fit themselves onscreen in a nicer fashion
  - tweak: Admin tabs are now combined into one "admin" tab with subsections, unless
      you use the "toggle split admin tabs" which changes it back to basically what
      it used to be.
