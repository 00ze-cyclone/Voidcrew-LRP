changes:
  - rscadd: Added the AK-47 automatic rifle as well as its ammo, both of which can
      only be obtained through cargo purchases.
  - balance: Changed the price of the Russian Surplus crate accordingly in order to
      balance the weapon, as suggested by TetraZeta. Also changed the damage amount
      done by the ammo type, as it was a bit too high (killed in only 7 shots with
      an automatic weapon).
  - imageadd: Added a new sprite for the AK-47.
  - code_imp: Coded the AK-47 and its ammo.
